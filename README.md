# 8086-AES-Encryption-Implementation
Implementing AES Encryption on 8086 Processor using Assembly Language Programming. Developing a 128-bit AES encryption algorithm with SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey modules, and key scheduling on an 8086 processor.
##
Our project involved implementing the AES algorithm on an 8086 processor. We used assembly language, macros, and 
interrupts to implement the different stages of the algorithm, including SubBytes(), ShiftRows(), MixColumns(), and AddRoundKey(). 
We also implemented the Key Schedule to generate the round keys used in the AddRoundKey() stage. Our implementation required a good understanding 
of the algorithm, efficient coding skills, and the ability to test and verify the implementation using the provided test case. Overall, we were able to successfully implement AES on an 8086 processor, demonstrating our skills in assembly programming andÂ cryptography.
