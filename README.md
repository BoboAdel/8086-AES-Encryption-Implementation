# 8086-AES-Encryption-Implementation
Implementing AES Encryption on 8086 Processor using Assembly Language Programming. Developing a 128-bit AES encryption algorithm with SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey modules, and key scheduling on an 8086 processor.
##
The project involved implementing the AES algorithm on an 8086 processor. Assembly language, macros, and 
interrupts were used to implement the different stages of the algorithm, including SubBytes(), ShiftRows(), MixColumns(), and AddRoundKey(). 
The Key Schedule was implemented to generate the round keys used in the AddRoundKey() stage. The implementation required a good understanding 
of the algorithm, efficient coding skills, and the ability to test and verify the implementation using the provided test case. Overall, the project was a successful implementation of AES on an 8086 processor, demonstrating the skills in assembly programming andÂ cryptography.
